# OpenAI for Grasshopper

This Grasshopper plugin (.gha) is a quick implementation of the OpenAI API for .NET: https://github.com/betalgo/openai  

I made in a few hours the necessary components to play with the OpenAI API. Keep in mind that it is still a work in progress, not everything has been tested, and it may not be continued.

3. Download [Sample.gh](https://github.com/DanielAbalde/OpenAI-for-Grasshopper/releases) file and open it. There are errors on components because it needs your API key.

5. Create a new secret key from your [OpenAI account](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

7. Be sure to check your usage frequently from your [OpenAI account](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage).	Please note that you may need to put your bank card and be charged for using it. Make sure you understand pricing and usage limits.
8. Enjoy!
