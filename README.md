# OpenAI for Grasshopper

This Grasshopper plugin (.gha) is a quick implementation of the OpenAI API for .NET: https://github.com/betalgo/openai  

I simply made the necessary components to play with the OpenAI API in a few hours. Keep in mind that it is still a work in progress, not everything has been tested, and it may not be continued.
